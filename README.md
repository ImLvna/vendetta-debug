# Vendetta Debugger

A fork of @colin273/enmity-debugger, which is a remote debugger for [Vendetta](https://github.com/vendetta-mod). This connects over a websocket to the Discord app with Vendetta installed and allows you to execute JavaScript in the Discord app from the command line. The REPL in this debugger is a slightly modified version of the [default REPL in Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html), including the same commands and some support for multi-line code snippets.

## Installing

1. Download the debugger
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Meqativ/vendetta-debug && cd vendetta-debug
```

2. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm i --omit=optional
```
or, if you want `--help` and 21 more packages:
```bash
npm i --include=optional
```

## Running

To start the debugger, run this command from inside the `vendetta-debug` folder:

```bash
node .
```

For help on the options, `--help` or [look here](options.md).
